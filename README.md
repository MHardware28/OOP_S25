# OOP_S25
I used to throw the discus but now I only play lacrosse. I sometimes wish I went with just throwing though!
I learnt that unlike websites like google colab, github allows you to collab on projects without changing the main thing which lets you review your specific part or adjust whatever you want to without fearing you'll mess the main up.

# Object Oriented Programming - First Semester Summary

## Overview
In the first semester of my Object Oriented Programming (OOP) class, I was introduced to the core concepts of OOP and how they are implemented in programming languages such as Java and Python. The course emphasized writing modular, reusable, and maintainable code through the use of classes and objects.

## Topics Covered
- **Classes and Objects**: Understanding how to define classes and create instances (objects).
- **Encapsulation**: Keeping data safe by using access modifiers and getters/setters.
- **Inheritance**: Creating hierarchical relationships between classes to promote code reuse.
- **Polymorphism**: Implementing method overriding and method overloading.
- **Abstraction**: Hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features.
- **Constructors and Destructors**
- **Static vs Instance Members**

## Projects and Assignments
- **Mini Banking System**: Simulated a basic banking application using classes and inheritance.
- **Student Record System**: Created a program to manage student data with CRUD operations.
- **Practice Exercises**: Regular problems to reinforce class structure, inheritance, and polymorphism.

## Key Takeaways
- Learned how to structure programs using OOP principles.
- Improved debugging skills and code readability through encapsulation and modular design.
- Understood the importance of planning and design before coding.

## Goals for Next Semester
- Dive deeper into advanced OOP concepts like interfaces, abstract classes, and design patterns.
- Work on a larger project applying OOP principles in a real-world scenario.
- Learn more about GUI development and how OOP principles apply to event-driven programming.
