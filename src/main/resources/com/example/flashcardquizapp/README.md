# ðŸ§  Flashcard Quiz App

## ðŸ“‹ Description

The Flashcard Quiz App is a simple JavaFX desktop application that allows users to review flashcards for quick studying and self-quizzing. Each flashcard contains a question and an answer. Users can flip through the flashcards, view the question, and then reveal the answer with the click of a button.

This project demonstrates clean object-oriented programming principles using Java and JavaFX. It features encapsulation, modular class design, and inheritance, with optional polymorphism available for future extension (e.g., different flashcard types).
